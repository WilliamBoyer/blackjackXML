XML for blackjack game


I am going to make a Vegas style video BlackJack game with a player and a computer.
The player has a hand and a wallet with cash that he uses to puchase credits for his digital bank.
The Computer converts the players money to credits, holds the deck, deals the cards, holds
a hand, then plays it's own hand vs the players.
